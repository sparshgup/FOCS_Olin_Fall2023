Remarks, if any:



--------------------------------------------------

Please fill in this file with your solutions and submit it

The functions below are stubs that you should replace with your
own implementation.

PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE THE TYPES IN THE STUBS BELOW.
Doing so risks making it impossible for me to test your code.

Always make sure you can :load this file in a FRESH ghci shell
before submitting it. It has to load without any errors.
